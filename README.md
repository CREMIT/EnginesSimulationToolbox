This repository contains the different MATLAB scripts developed by Professor Jesus Alvarez Director of the CREMIT in the Mechanical Engineering School in UPC (Engines and Heat Transfer Department). The scope of these scripts is teaching, they are not devoted to research or experimentation.

**FILES DESCRIPTION:**

"Wiebe_Nusselt.m": Program to simulate the compression-combustion-expansion cycle in a piston. The program includes the Wiebe model for the combustion and a simplified Nusselt approach for the heat transfer process.
